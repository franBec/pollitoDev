## Context

I think that as a 1,5 year web developer, I already have a good understanding of how websites work.

## Review

The course is very beginner-oriented and starts with an introduction to the structure of websites and how they function. Then moves on to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the three main languages used in web development.

It includes exercises that allow you to play around with HTML code and experiment with different styles and layouts. This makes it easier to understand how different HTML tags and attributes affect the look and feel of a website.

Overall, I would highly recommend the course to anyone who is new to web development, if you already have experience with HTML CSS and JavaScript, you may find this course too basic.

## Conclusion
