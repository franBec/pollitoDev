This is the third part of my [VPS blog series](/en/categories/vps/).

## What is Coolify? (and why choose it?)
[Coolify](https://coolify.io/) is an open-source, self-hostable platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that lets you deploy and manage web apps, databases, and services directly on your own server. Think of it as a self-hosted Heroku alternative—but without vendor lock-in or surprise bills.

### Key Features
- **One-Click Deployments:** Launch apps from Git repositories, Docker images, or pre-built templates.
- **Full Ownership:** Host everything on your VPS, with no third-party dependencies.
- **Multi-Server Support:** Manage apps across multiple servers from a single dashboard.
- **Automated HTTPS:** Built-in Let’s Encrypt integration for free SSL certificates.
- **Docker-Native:** Works seamlessly with Docker containers.

### Why Coolify Over Alternatives?
- **Simplicity vs. Control:** Tools like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Render](https://render.com/) simplify deployments but limit customization. Coolify gives you ease while retaining full server control.
- **Cost-Effective:** Unlike paid platforms, Coolify is 100% free and open-source. You pay only for where you run it (your VPS).
- **Avoid Kubernetes complexity:** For small-to-medium projects, Kubernetes (k8s) is overkill. Coolify offers lightweight orchestration without the steep learning curve.

## Install Coolify

First, log in to your VPS as the **root user** and run the [official Coolify installation script](https://coolify.io/self-hosted/):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```
This script installs all dependencies and starts Coolify automatically. Once complete, you’ll see a confirmation that Coolify is running at `http://<your-server-ip>:8000`.

## Initial setup

### Access the dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to `http://<your-server-ip>:8000`. You’ll see the Coolify setup screen:

![coolify-create-account](/uploads/2025-01-30-vps-3/coolify-create-account.png)

- Enter a name, email and password.
- Click Register.

### Choosing your server type

After logging in, you’ll be prompted to set up your server:

![coolify-choose-server](/uploads/2025-01-30-vps-3/coolify-choose-server.png)

- **Localhost:** This refers to the same VPS where Coolify is installed. Ideal for testing or lightweight workloads, but not recommended for production (high server load could crash the Coolify dashboard).
- **Remote Server:** Use this if you want Coolify to manage a separate VPS (better for production resilience).

For this blog series, we’ll use **Localhost** for simplicity.

## Configure HTTPS and domains

### DNS records setup

To secure Coolify with HTTPS and assign a domain: Create two DNS A records for your domain (e.g., apps.yourdomain.com):

- Wildcard subdomain: * → `<your-server-ip>`
- Apex domain: @ → `<your-server-ip>`

![hostinger-dns](/uploads/2025-01-30-vps-3/hostinger-dns.png)

This allows any subdomain (e.g., `coolify.apps.yourdomain.com`) to resolve to your server.

### Coolify instance domain

In Coolify’s `Settings → Configuration`, set:

1. Instance Domain: `https://coolify.apps.yourdomain.com` (replace with your domain).
2. Uncheck Validate DNS, as it may not work properly in some cases. 
3. Uncheck "Auto Update Enabled" (manual updates are recommended).
4. Save changes.

### Wildcard domain for apps

1. Navigate to `Servers → Localhost → Configuration`.
2. Under Wildcard Domain, enter your root domain (e.g., `https://apps.yourdomain.com`).
3. Save to enable automatic subdomain routing for future apps.

## Switch to Caddy Proxy

**Ensure your VPS still allows connection through ports 80/443 before this step!** Switching proxy will temporarily disable access over HTTPS.

- So far we haven't setup any firewall rules, so we should be good to go.

By default, Coolify uses [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/). It is a totally valid option, but in this VPS series we'll switch to [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) cause of its simpler configuration:

1. Go to `Servers → Localhost → Proxy`.
2. Stop the current proxy.
3. Select Caddy and click Switch Proxy.
4. Restart the proxy.

Visit `https://coolify.apps.yourdomain.com`. If the login page loads, your setup was successful!

## Create a firewall

Now that Coolify is accessible via HTTPS, it’s critical to lock down unnecessary ports to minimize attack vectors. Here’s how to configure a firewall to restrict access to only essential ports.

### Create the rules

![hostinger-firewall](/uploads/2025-01-30-vps-3/hostinger-firewall.png)

1. **Access Your VPS Firewall Dashboard:** Most VPS providers have a built-in firewall tool.
2. **Allow Critical Ports** by creating rules to permit traffic for:
   - **SSH (Port 22)**: Mandatory for server access. *(If you’ve changed your SSH port, use that instead).*
   - **HTTP (Port 80).**
   - **HTTPS (Port 443).**
3. **Deny All Other Ports.** By default, firewalls block all traffic not explicitly allowed.
4. **Apply the firewall.**

### Verify the Configuration
1. **Test Blocked Ports:** Try accessing Coolify via its old HTTP port (e.g., `http://<your-server-ip>:8000`). The connection should **fail**, confirming the firewall is active.
2. **Confirm HTTPS Access:** Visit `https://coolify.yourdomain.com`. The dashboard should load normally, proving traffic is now funneled exclusively through secure ports.
