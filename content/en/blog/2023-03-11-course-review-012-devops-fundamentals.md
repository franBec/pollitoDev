## Context

I already had prior knowledge of DevOps from taking the Google Cloud Digital Leader Exam.

## Review

The course begins with an introductory section on DevOps, which is informative for beginners.

The section on Git covers installation and repository setup, tracking changes, index areas, local repositories, branching, and merging, which it felt was overly detailed.

The course also covers Jenkins and its role in creating a DevOps pipeline, along with brief introductions to Chef and containers. However, I was disappointed with the lack of in-depth coverage of these topics.

Overall, while the course does provide a solid foundation for beginners, it may benefit from adding more content on other important DevOps tools and practices.

## Conclusion

Upon completing the course, I felt that it may have been too beginner-friendly.

While the course covers all the essential concepts of DevOps, it seemed to spend an excessive amount of time explaining Git, which I felt was unnecessary for those who are already familiar with it. Additionally, I found that the course lacked sufficient depth and breadth of content, leaving me wanting more.

| Are the practices good?                     | Does not have any |
| Does it meet expectations?                  | No                |
| Is the instructor an expert on the subject? | I guess so        |

**Personal score:** 4 / 5, is a nice intro to DevOps, but not much else
