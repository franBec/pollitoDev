## Context

I already had some knowledge of bash scripting as I took a university course where I had to automate a task to run overnight on a Linux server. This required me to write a bash script that could perform a specific task automatically without any human intervention.

## Review

The course begins with an introduction to bash scripting and covers the setup of a development environment. From there, the course covers variables, parameters, if statements, loops, arrays, network scripts, output redirection, and functions.

Each topic is accompanied by code examples that help to understand the concepts better. The instructor also provides quizzes and assignments that allowed me to test my knowledge and practice what I learned.

The video lectures are short and to the point. The course is suitable for beginners while being also relevant to system administrators and developers looking to automate tasks in Linux.

## Conclusion
