## Context

Before taking this course, I already had experience developing with the Grails framework, and knew the basics of Spring. However, I had no practical experience developing applications using Spring Boot.

Therefore, I decided to take this course to improve my skills and gain deeper knowledge of Spring Boot, in order to successfully fulfill the role as Java Backend Developer at [Applica](http://www.applica-mobile.com/?lang=en) that I had recently acquired back then.

## Review

This course focuses on teaching Spring Boot as a framework for developing web applications, rather than delving into technical details specific to Spring.

Spring Boot is an extension to Spring that allows developers to build applications faster and easier by providing default settings that fit most common use cases. Instead of focusing on the technical details internal to Spring, Spring Boot focuses on providing tools and features that developers can use to build modern, scalable web applications more efficiently.

The course starts with the basics of Spring Boot, and then progresses to concepts such as:

- Use of technologies such as Hibernate, JPA and Thymeleaf
- Application of design patterns, best practices and multilayer enterprise architectures
- Transaction management
- Security in web applications
- Messages inside property files
- Internationalization (i18n) for multilingual applications

A wide variety of examples and practical exercises are provided to apply the concepts learned. In addition, the creation of a complete real-world application is included, which helps to understand how this knowledge can be applied in real projects.

And as if that were not enough, this course gives access to two other bonus courses:

- Fundamentals of Java: teaches from basic concepts \(variables, operators, control statements\) to more advanced topics \(polymorphism, exceptions, JDBC, servlets and JSPs, DAO and DTO design patterns\)
- HTML/CSS/Javascript: teaches how to create web pages using HTML and CSS, and then focuses on JavaScript

## Course related skills

- Web application development: How to create web applications using the Spring Boot framework, creating scalable and robust applications
- Knowledge of Spring Boot architecture
- Knowledge of Java programming
- Database management: Spring Boot makes it easy to connect and manage databases in applications
- Development of RESTful APIs: Construction of web services that communicate efficiently with other applications

## Conclusion

The course is quite extensive, since in addition to teaching Spring Boot, the bonus courses on Fundamentals of Java and HTML/CSS/Javascript make it necessary to dedicate a large amount of time to finish it \(I started it in November 2022 and I finished it in February 2023\).

Through the course, I was able to learn how to develop more complex and efficient web applications using Spring Boot, which allowed me to acquire the necessary skills to face the challenges that arose in my work, and increase my efficiency and quality in code delivery.

Overall, this course has been a valuable addition to my training as a Java developer and has significantly improved my performance in my current role.
