## Context

At the time of taking this course, I already had knowledge of Node.js due to a personal project that I was doing in my free time.

## Review

This course addresses the creation of a user registration system with email notification and a login interface with authentication, using Node.js as backend.

I couldn't help but feel that the course is aimed more at beginners, since various issues unrelated to node are explained, such as installing Visual Studio Code or creating a MySQL database.

The instructor is engaged with the content: GitHub repositories are used by chapters so that the student can reference the material at any time.

The content of the course covers aspects such as

- Data manipulation (CRUD)
- Authentication, user roles, and security
- Image upload
- Deploy to Heroku

The course provides a solid foundation for those who want to learn Node.js and build fullstack systems.

## Course related skills

- Implementation of a user registration and authentication system with JWT security
- Implementation of an AdminLTE UI template and use of Bootstrap for CSS styling and responsive behavior
- Use of an EJS templating engine to create dynamic views and render data from the database
- Implementation of CRUD operations on the MySQL database using an ORM package \(Sequelize\)
- Upload and handling of image files using an Express middleware \(Multer\)
- Implementation of a notification system via email for user registration
- Deploy the application on Heroku

## Conclusion

I think this course can be useful for those who want to learn how to develop demos or simple projects using Node.js. However, when growing to more serious and complex projects, it is important to keep in mind that there are more robust and scalable alternatives such as Angular, Next.js, or Nest.js, which have great popularity and support from the community, but that can be more complicated and less beginner-friendly
