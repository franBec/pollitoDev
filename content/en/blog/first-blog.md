After delaying for quite a time, finally decided to start a blog. My main objective is **writing stuff that may help fellow web developers**

To archieve that objective, I have the following blog categories in mind:

- **&ldquo;The weekly update&ldquo;**: Once a week, probably friday night, I'll write a new post about my week at work. Even on those weeks where not much is happenning, I'm sure I can extract some thoughts about tasks or chit-chat I had with my coworkers

- **&ldquo;I learned X, and here are my thoughts about it&ldquo;**: Here I’ll document my process about learning a given technology. The things I liked, hated, and confused me about the technology in particular, and if I’ll use it as a web developer, as a hobby, or never. This will also motivate me to learn things so I can add content to the blog

- **&ldquo;Oddly specific tutorials&ldquo;**: I think an example will explain it better. I was once assigned the task of making a Node application query a very old Oracle database, and dockerize it. Me along 3 coworkers spent a couple of days because of the rarity of the task, and was kinda frustrating. I would've loved to find a tutorial on the matter, but there was none. So, maybe I'll be the first to make one

- **&ldquo;Personal stuff&ldquo;**: I plan this to be a developer blog, but maybe I'll write from time to time personal stuff. As stated in the main page, I'm someone who loves others things outside programming
