## Context

Before taking the course, my knowledge of Redis was limited to knowing that it is a NoSQL database, and a fireship 100 seconds video explanation.

## Review

This review is short cause this course is short \(it is not even an hour long, so don't expect to become the greatest expert here\). It is an excellent resource for beginners who are looking to learn about Redis and its possible usage in their development projects.

The instructor provided clear and detailed instructions to set up Redis on a local environment. The course also delved into various options and configurations available in Redis. The Redis command-line interface (redis-cli) was thoroughly explained.

The course focused on key-value storage, data structures, and transactions.

## Course related skills

- Install and configure Redis on local environment, understanding the various options and configurations available
- How to use Redis as a database, including key-value storage, data structures, and transactions
- Exposure to a different paradigm compared to traditional SQL databases, understanding the unique features and use cases of Redis as an in-memory data store

## Conclusion

The course is an ok resource for anyone who want to learn what is Redis. Is not much, but is ok-ish.
