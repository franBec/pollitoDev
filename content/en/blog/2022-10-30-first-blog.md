_\(Potrero de los Funes, San Luis, Argentina\)_

After delaying for quite a time, I finally decided to start a blog. My main goal is **to document my journey as a developer**. To achieve that goal, I'll write aboutâ€¦

* **Work stuff:** Even if little happens, I can surely extract some thoughts about tasks or chats with my coworkers.
* **Personal stuff:** I like to do other things outside of programming. I have to take advantage of this _corner of the internet_ to leave a mark.
