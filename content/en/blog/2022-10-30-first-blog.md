_\(Potrero de los Funes, San Luis, Argentina\)_

After delaying for quite a time, finally decided to start a blog. My main objective is **to document my journey as a developer**. To archieve that objective, I'll write about....

**Work stuff:** Even if not much happens, I can surely extract some thoughts about tasks or chats with my coworkers

**Personal stuff:** Just like it says on the front page, I'm someone who likes to do other things outside of programming. You have to take advantage of this _corner of the internet_ to leave a mark
