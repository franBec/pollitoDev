## What is &ldquo;Roundest Pokémon&rdquo;?

"Roundest Pokémon" is a common programming exercise that consist of an interactive voting game to decide which Pokémon is the roundest.

We're going to add a twist to it: the ability to choose which backend system processes the vote.

![backend-selector](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/backend-selector.gif)

This feature will help us illustrate how different systems can be deployed and work together seamlessly, all deployed in the VPS under a Coolify project.

![vote-flow](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/vote-flow.gif)

## What we are going to need?

- A database (I'm going with [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/))
  - A database admin: Not crucial for the app itself, but needed to create and edit schemas if you don't want to [rely on Hibernate's DDL Auto feature](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/221379/hibernate-hbm2ddl-auto-update-in-production). I'm going to use [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).
- The [frontend app](https://github.com/franBec/roundest_nextjs) (I used Next.js).
- The different backend apps:
  - [Java](https://github.com/franBec/roundest_java), language I'm currently working with, I feel like a fish in water here.
  - [Kotlin](https://github.com/franBec/roundest_kotlin), was curious to give it a try, did disappoint a bit.
  - [Groovy](https://github.com/franBec/roundest_groovy), my first love, and I still love it.

All the apps were written by me. Blogs on them coming up sometime in the future.

## Add PostgreSQL Resource

1. Create a New Project:
   - Click **Projects** in the left menu.
   - Click **Add a new project**.
   - Name it "roundest_pokemon".
   - Click **Create**. You should have a "roundest_pokemon" project created.
   ![coolify-projects](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/coolify-projects.png)
2. Add a New PostgreSQL Resource:
   - Go to your **"roundest_pokemon"** project.
   - Click **+ New**.
   - Under **Databases**, select **Postgres**.
   ![projects-postgres.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/projects-postgres.png)
   - Select the default option, as we just need a simple SQL database here.
   ![postgres-16](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/postgres-16.png)
   - Leave everything as default, click **Start**.
   ![postgres-start](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/postgres-start.png)

**How can we manage the database?**

- **Exposing the database to the public internet:** a totally valid option, but that would imply:
  - Changing firewall configurations to expose a new port to the open internet.
  - Being at risk to brute force passwords attacks.
- **Use a web-based interface to manage the database without exposing it publicly:** keeps the database private while allowing to run queries inside the internal network.

Let's go for the latter approach.

## pgAdmin
### Add the Docker Resource

1. Go to your "roundest_pokemon" project.
   - **Very important to be inside the same project**, if not, pgAdmin will not be able to reach the already created database.
2. Click **+ New**.
3. Under **Docker Based**, select **Docker Image**.
4. You'll be asked to prompt an image name. Put `dpage/pgadmin4` and click **Save**.
5. Give it a domain (like `https://pgadmin4.yourdomain.com`) and click **Save**.
   ![docker-image-pgadmin4](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/docker-image-pgadmin4.png)
6. In **Enviroment Variables** add the credentials you will use to log into pgAdmin:
   - `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`
   - `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` (keep it alphanumerical, not symbols)

   ![pgadmin-credentials.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/pgadmin-credentials.png)

### Add a new server

1. Go to `pgadmin4.yourdomain.com` and log in with the credentials you put into the `dpage/pgadmin4` enviroment variables.
2. Once in, go to **Add new server**.

    ![pgadmin4.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/pgadmin4.png)
3. In **General**, you can give it any name you want
4. In **Connection**, you need to fill:
    - **Host name/address:** the hostname from the PostgreSQL internal URL (is between `@` and the `:5432`).
    - **Port:** by default is `5432`.
    - **Username:** the username from the PostgreSQL.
   ![postgres-conf.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/postgres-conf.png)

   ![pgadmin-connection.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/pgadmin-connection.png)
5. On save, you'll be asked the password.

Now you are able to execute queries to the database, while keeping it safe inside the internal network.

### Populate initial data

1. In the left sidebar, under **Servers** -> _the server you just added_ -> **Databases** -> **Schemas**, right click and select **Query Tool**. That will open a Query console.

    ![pgadmin-query-tool.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/pgadmin-query-tool.png)

2. Paste and execute [this sql script](https://github.com/franBec/roundest_java/blob/main/src/main/resources/data.sql) that creates a table for te Pokémon + inserts the 1st generation Pokémon with initial 0 votes.
3. Retrieve the created data to check everything is OK.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pokemons;
```
![pgadmin-select-pokemon.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/pgadmin-select-pokemon.png)

### Create a specific user for your application

Creating a specific user for your application (instead of using the default postgres superuser or other admin accounts) is a security and operational best practice.

Let's create a user for with access limited to the public schema:

```sql
-- Create backend_app_user
CREATE USER backend_app_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password_here';

-- Grant Basic Connection Permissions
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO backend_app_user;

-- Grant Schema Permissions
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO backend_app_user;

-- Grant Table Permissions: For existing tables
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO backend_app_user;

-- Grant Table Permissions: For future tables (default privileges)
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO backend_app_user;

-- Grant Sequence Permissions: For existing sequences
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO backend_app_user;

-- Grant Sequence Permissions: For future sequences
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO backend_app_user;
```

## Create a GitHub Application in Coolify

### Why?

- To deploy private repositories.
- To enable automatic deployments via webhooks.

### How?

1. **Access Sources in Coolify:**
   - Navigate to **Sources** in your Coolify dashboard.
   - Click **Add** to create a new GitHub application.
2. **Configure the GitHub Application:**
   - Provide a **unique name** for your GitHub app (e.g., `coolify-pollito-tech`). The name is globally unique across GitHub.
   - Set the **Webhook Endpoint** to your Coolify instance's **HTTPS URL** (HTTP may cause webhook delivery issues).
   - Click **Register Now** to proceed to GitHub.
   
   ![github-app-register.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/github-app-register.png)
3. **Configure Repository Access on GitHub:**
   - Follow the principle of "least privilege", only grant access to repositories you plan to deploy.
   - Click **Install** to finalize the GitHub app setup.
4. **Verify Permissions in Coolify:**
   - Return to Coolify and click **Refetch** to confirm the GitHub app has the correct permissions.
   - A successful configuration will show the app has access to your selected repositories.

   ![github-app-save.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/github-app-save.png)

To add new repositories later, click **Update Repositories**. This redirects you to GitHub, where you can update repository access.


## Deploy using GitHub App

### Spring Boot backend

Let's deploy one of the backend applications.

1. Go to your "roundest_pokemon" project.
    - **Very important to be inside the same project**, if not, the application will not be able to reach the already created database.
2. Click **+ New**.
3. Under **Git Based**, select **Private Repository (with GitHub App)**.
    ![resource-github-app.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/resource-github-app.png)
4. Choose the repository containing the application.
   - You can leave everything else as default, as you can configure it in the following step.
5. **Configure Application Settings:**
   - **Application Type**: This repo counts with a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/dockerfile/) that I personally battle tested a bit and so far seems to work fine. So let's select **Dockerfile**.
   - Add your **custom domain** (e.g., `app.your-domain.com`)
   ![roundest-groovy-conf1.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/roundest-groovy-conf1.png)
   - By scrolling a little bit, you'll find the **Network** section. For these backends apps, in **Ports exposes** set `8080`. The port can vary between different types of apps.
   ![roundest-groovy-conf2.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/roundest-groovy-conf2.png)
   - In **Environment Variables** add all those that the app needs. In this particular app, I need the database host, port, db, username, and password. Remember to use the specific database user-password we created earlier.
6.  **Deploy**, Coolify will:
   - Clone your repository.
   - Build the Docker image using your Dockerfile.
   - Deploy the container with your configured domain and environment variables.

Visit `https://app.your-domain.com` to confirm the app is live.
![roundest-groovy-live.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/roundest-groovy-live.png)

Dance and repeat for all similar Spring Boot apps.

### Next.js frontend

The deployment process for Next.js applications is nearly identical to the Spring Boot backend, with one key configuration change:

1. Go to your project (e.g., "roundest_pokemon").
    - **Same project requirement applies**, this ensures the frontend can communicate with backend services.
2. Click **+ New** -> **Private Repository (with GitHub App)**.
3. Select your Next.js repository.
4. **Configure Application Settings:**
    - **Application Type**: Select [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs). It automatically detects Next.js and handles build optimizations.
    - Add your **frontend domain** (e.g., `vote.your-domain.com`).
   ![roundest-nextjs-conf1.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/roundest-nextjs-conf1.png)
    - In the **Network** section: Set exposed port to `3000` (default Next.js port).
   ![roundest-nextjs-conf2.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/roundest-nextjs-conf2.png)
    - Add any required **Environment Variables**.
5. **Deploy**.

You may interact with my final result [here](https://roundest-pokemon.pollito.tech/). I don't promise to keep it up forever, as I may use this VPS for another projects that may need the computer power.

## VPS resource usage

This screenshot captures the VPS **running on idle**, showing various resource metrics.

![stats.png](/uploads/2025-02-03-vps-5/stats.png)

Let's remember this VPS is running:
- A Next.js app.
- A Java app.
- A Kotlin app.
- A Groovy app.
- A database (Postgres).
- A databse manager (pgadmin).
- Glances (monitoring).
- Coolify, the admin panel from where we manage the apps.

### System Overview
- **CPU**: The system is using around **8.1% CPU**, with most usage coming from background processes.
- **Memory**: **34.3% of RAM** is in use, with some swap space allocated but not actively utilized.
- **Load Average**: The system load remains low, with a 15-minute average of **0.26**, indicating minimal activity.
- **Disk I/O**: No significant read/write operations happening, meaning no heavy disk usage.
- **Network**: Minimal network activity, with only a few kilobytes of data being transferred.

### Container & Process Activity
- Multiple **Docker containers** are running, but they are mostly idle.
- The **highest CPU-consuming processes** include:
    - `python3` running `glances` for monitoring.
    - `dockerd` managing containers.
    - Background services like `redis-server` and `php-fpm`, needed for Coolify
    - `java` processes (the backend systems).

### Critical Alerts
The system has logged **high CPU usage alerts** in the past due to `java`, `python3`, and `dockerd`. This was during deployment of the backend services.

## A heartfelt conclusion to the VPS journey

This has become my favourite series of blog I ever wrote.

I want to take a moment to reflect on how far we’ve come together. When we first asked, _“What is a VPS?”_

- In **Part 1**, we acknowledged the allure of serverless while embracing the timeless value of having control over your own server. You don’t need to build the next Facebook to deserve infrastructure that’s reliable, flexible, and yours.
- In **Part 2**, we rolled up our sleeves and built a foundation: choosing a provider, hardening security, and laying the groundwork for everything to come. It wasn’t glamorous, but like planting a tree, it set down roots for growth.
- Then came **Part 3**, where Coolify entered the stage, transforming our VPS from a blank canvas into a powerful toolkit. With proxies, HTTPS, and firewalls, we turned complexity into simplicity—proving that modern server management can be both robust and approachable.
- **Part 4** brought our server to life with Glances, a real-time dashboard secured by Caddy.
- Finally, in **Part 5**, we went full-circle—deploying a full-stack app with a database.

This series was about the joy of crafting a space that’s entirely yours, free from the whims of opaque cloud pricing or one-size-fits-all solutions. It was about **quiet confidence**: knowing that even if your app stays small, it’ll run smoothly, securely, and on your terms.

As you move forward, remember that **every expert was once a beginner hitting ssh for the first time**. Your server is a companion, not a critic. Experiment, break things (then fix them!), and celebrate the milestones, whether it’s nailing a firewall rule or deploying that first app.

If you’ve followed along, you’re now equipped not just with a VPS, but with the courage to shape it into whatever your projects demand. Keep tinkering, keep learning, and most importantly, keep building things that matter to you.

I wish you a happy hosting! ~Pollito <🐤/>
