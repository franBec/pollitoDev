## Context

I already had prior knowledge of multithreading from taking courses in operating systems, distributed systems, and parallel computing during my university education.

## Review

The course covers a wide range of important topics in multithreading and concurrency in Java, such as: memory management, monitor/mutex, race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks.

The instructor provides detailed explanations with clear examples, making it easy to understand and implement the concepts. The course is well-structured, with each topic covered in small sections followed by a quiz to test the student's understanding.

The instructor's teaching approach is clear and concise, and the examples used in the course are practical and relevant. However, the instructor goes too in-depth in analyzing the Java classes, which at the end of the day as a developer, you are abstracted from all that complexity.

- Synchronization: How to work with monitor/mutex, and how to avoid race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks
- Use of executor services in Java, including callable and future interfaces
- Use of the lock API in JDK: lock, read-write lock, reentrant lock, reentrant read-write lock, and stamped lock
- Writing of asynchronous/parallel programming code using functional style APIs and completable future
- Synchronizers: How to use synchronizers such as cyclic barrier, count down latch, semaphore, exchanger, and phaser

## Conclusion

While the instructor provides detailed explanations with clear examples, I felt overwhelmed by the depth of analysis in the Java classes. And even though I already had knowledge of multithreading and concurrency from previous coursework, this course was an excellent way to learn and improve my skills in multithreading and concurrency in Java.
