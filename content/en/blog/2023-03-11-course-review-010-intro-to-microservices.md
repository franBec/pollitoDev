## Context

I already had prior knowledge of microservices from taking the Google Cloud Digital Leader Exam.

## Review

The course is very well structured and the content is presented in a clear and concise manner. It is only about 45 minutes long and does not cover advanced level design patterns or frameworks. However, this makes it a perfect starting point for beginners who want to get a good understanding of Microservices architecture.

The course contains topics such as:

- Traditional Monolithic Architecture and the issues associated with it
- The evolution of architecture from Monoliths to Microservices
- The differences between Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Microservices
- Benefits and challenges of implementing Microservices-based architecture

## Course related skills

## Conclusion

As I have already acquired knowledge on Microservices from taking the Google Cloud Digital Leader Exam, I did not learn much from this course. Nonetheless, for beginners who are looking for a solid starting point to learn about Microservices architecture, this course is ok-ish.
