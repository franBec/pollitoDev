## Context

I was completely unaware of Spring Framework and how it works. I knew that Grails, the framework I've been using since day 1 as a web developer, was built on top of Spring, but I didn't have a deep understanding of the framework itself.

## Review

The structure of the course is very clear and organized. The table of contents is very complete and covers from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

- Unit 1 introduces the Spring core and the reflection API, resulting in a solid foundation for understanding how the framework works
- Unit 2 deepens the understanding of Spring, containers and beans
- Unit 3 addresses the connection between beans
- Unit 4 studies the expression language SpEL
- Unit 5 teaches how to minimize configuration in XML, which allows for cleaner and more organized code
- Unit 6 deals with unit tests
- Unit 7 addresses automatic bean discovery
- Unit 8 focuses on aspect-oriented programming and Spring AOP
- Unit 9 was a very brief introduction to RMI \(Remote Method Invocation\). Explains how you can connect different applications in a network

Regarding the methodology, the course consisted of virtual classes of two hours a week, which allowed direct contact with the instructor, facilitating the resolution of doubts and the understanding of the topics.

The recommended practices for each topic were very useful, as they allow you to put what you have learned into practice and consolidate your knowledge.

At the end of the course, the knowledge acquired was evaluated in a multiple choice exam.

## Course related skills

- Understanding of the fundamental concepts of the Spring Framework and how it is applied in the development of Java applications
- Knowledge of the different programming techniques and patterns used in Spring, such as dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming (AOP)
- Familiarity with the main features of Spring, including containers, beans and modules, to connect to databases and web services
- Use Spring tools, such as the SpEL expression language and the JUnit and Mockito testing framework
- Knowledge of RMI to develop distributed applications

## Conclusion

Although as a Java Backend developer I do not directly apply all the concepts learned in this course, it is important to have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. These concepts underlie many of the technologies and frameworks used in the development of modern business applications.

By having a deep understanding of how the Spring Framework works, you can better understand how the different components of an application interact and how to optimize their performance.

In short, although they are not directly applied on a day-to-day basis, these concepts are used implicitly and it is beneficial to know them to develop quality applications and keep up-to-date in the field of enterprise Java programming.

In conclusion, the course is highly recommended for any developer who wants to gain a solid knowledge of Spring. The structure of the course, the methodology and the recommended practices make it a very enriching experience.
