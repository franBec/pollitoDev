## Context

In April 2022 I was able to establish a connection with [Juan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanjoserodriguezv/), a Google Cloud expert. He recommended to me that in order to advance as a programmer, I didn't need to learn more programming languages, but to have a broader vision of how web projects really work and how cloud services are involved in it.

## Review

It is an excellent course for professionals looking to gain basic knowledge in the cloud and digital transformation. It is designed to help identify Google Cloud products and solutions that support digital transformation, explain how cloud technology and data can be leveraged to innovate within organizations, and identify key change patterns and products of Google Cloud for infrastructure and application modernization. The course content is relevant to current industry needs.

The course consists of four modules:

- Introduction to digital transformation
- Innovation with data
- Infrastructure and application modernization
- Security and operations in Google Cloud

Each module is well structured, easy to understand, and provides real-world examples and scenarios to apply the knowledge. Assessments at the end of each module are useful to validate and demonstrate learning outcomes.
