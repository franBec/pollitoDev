## Context

Before taking this course, I already had previous knowledge of Scrum thanks to the training I received as a developer when I joined [Runaid](https://www.runaid.com.ar/index.php?languaje=en)

## Review

The course covers from basic concepts \(roles, artifacts, events, sprint, transparency\), to advanced aspects such as scaling Scrum in large projects. It delves into the processes and phases of a software project, using the SBOK \(Scrum Body Of Knowledge\) as a guide.

The videos are short, which makes it easy to follow and understand. In addition, the course includes assignments and quizzes that allow you to apply what you have learned and test your understanding of the material.

The instructor also addresses topics such as the demand for Scrum Masters in the industry and Scrum certifications. In addition, he offers templates and tools for project management and software quality, which is very useful to apply in practice.

Overall, the course is a great option for those interested in learning Scrum. The provided materials and tools are of great help to those who want to implement Scrum in their organization or in their daily work.
