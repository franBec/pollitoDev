## Context

Before taking this course, I already had previous knowledge of Scrum thanks to the training I received as a developer when I joined [Runaid](https://www.runaid.com.ar/index.php?languaje=en) and from a previous course.

## Review

The course covers the fundamentals of Scrum, including the Scrum framework, the different roles, as well as the tools and techniques used by the Scrum Master to facilitate team efforts. In addition, it introduces to different Scrum certifications like PSM and PSPO.

Now, talking about the quality of the course... it is quite bad. For starters, it is an audiobook adaptation, so the video component of the course, which is made up of stock footage, did not add anything relevant. Everything felt like someone reading definitions from Wikipedia. Finally, it did not provide any opportunities for students to practice the skills or concepts they were learning.

## Course related skills

- Understanding the Scrum framework
- Scrum roles and responsibilities: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developer
- Scrum master tools and techniques: Agile estimation, Sprint planning, and Retrospective
- Basic preparation for different Scrum certifications like PSM and PSPO

## Conclusion

While the course provides valuable insights, it lacks engagement and practical applications.
