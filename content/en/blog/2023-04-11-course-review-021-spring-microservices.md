## Context

Prior to taking this course, I had a theoretical understanding of microservices and their benefits in modern software development. However, the course provided me with practical examples that helped me implement what I had previously learned.

## Review

The course covers a wide range of topics related to developing and designing RESTful web services and microservices using Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud.

The first part of the course focuses on RESTful web services. It covers important concepts like versioning, exception handling, documentation using Swagger, basic authentication with Spring Security, filtering, and HATEOAS. The best practices in designing RESTful web services were also emphasized, which helped me gain a deeper understanding of industry standards.

The second part of the course provides a comprehensive overview of how to implement microservices using Spring Cloud. Topics covered include communication between microservices, load balancing, scaling, centralizing configuration with Spring Cloud Config Server, distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin, and creating fault-tolerant microservices with Hystrix.

The third part of the course introduces Docker, a widely used containerization tool. I found this section to be particularly useful as it provided hands-on experience in building containers for microservices using Docker and Spring Cloud.

The fourth part of the course provided a solid foundation for understanding how to orchestrate microservices using Kubernetes. Topics covered include deploying microservices using Kubernetes, managing pods, services, and scaling microservices.

## Conclusion

This course is looooooooooooong, it has a lot in it, and even you'll find instances where before a video the instructor says "the following videos are deprecated so skip to this other video where it is done with the current best practice".

The course materials, including slides and code samples, are a lot and scares you at the beggining, but they are well-organized and easy to follow. The instructor's expertise and passion for the subject matter were evident, and I felt motivated to learn and apply the concepts covered in the course.

I love the "welcome back" he says at the beggining of each video, makes you feel comfy when returning after a couple of days.

The course gave me the confidence and practical knowledge to apply microservices architecture in my own projects, something I'm gonna do for sure in my next endeavour.
