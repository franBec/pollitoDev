This blog is mostly a rant about how things are going on in my life. Don't expect any professionalism here. Feel free to don't read it, it ain't worth your time.

## Idk how to start this

So...

At Devsu's coaching classes, I was given the task of writing something about the movie "[Glory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097441/)". It is a nice war movie (US Civil War to be precise), and... Morgan Freeman is part of the cast, and... That's it. A good movie.

Lately I've been feeling like this, with no much motivation for doing a thing, even feeling apathy for things that used to interest me. Some people may call it burnout, I'm not 100% sure if that's the proper terminology, but fits good enough.

Let's search for some causes shall we.

## The minimum effort technique

At [Devsu](https://devsu.com/), I'm an assigned resource to [Banco Pichincha](https://www.pichincha.com/). It is the biggest private bank of Ecuador [says Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Pichincha), and the important people at the top are proud of that. But also Ecuador is a country with no real foreign banks competition. Why? Not sure, haven't looked into this country regulations. I think that this organization would've been shut so long ago if bigger fishes (Santander, Galicia, BBVA) had an easier time and got into the country.

The thing with Banco is that, I believe they may have watched some documentary about [how Spotify is architectured](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2013/03/backend-infrastructure-at-spotify/) and said "let's copy that". Not because something works for X company means it may work for you.

A few weeks ago, the architect of my team quitted (or was kicked? the gossip haven't reached my ears). My immediate thought was "how lucky, wish it was me". Without being at risk of breaking any NDA (that doesn't hold any real value cause I'm an Argentinian living in Europe, good luck demanding me), only **the login logic has 23 microservices.**

You can imagine being an architect (or my case a dev) in that mess isn't fun. The poor guy (and some of my fellow devs) had to work out of office hours. Dear ex-architect, wherever you are right now, with your amazing skills and knowledge, I hope you found peace dude. Nothing but respect for the outstanding work you've done.

Talking about out of office hours, I had to do one. Go on, laugh at it, I'm a crybaby. Am I gonna cry over **just one** extra out of office hour? Of course. I may be alone in life, no family, no partner, no pets, and spending my time watching anime or walking downtown eating McDonald's ice cream, but that's my free time, and I love my free time. It is worth more that whatever extra you pay me for staying late.

So I started applying what I called "The minimum effort technique": just do the things the jira task says you have to do. Not a line less, not a line more. No refactors, no cleaning code, no improving tests. It is not worth it.

Sadly that mentality conflicts with a thing that fights to win over: perfeccionism

## Ignorance is bliss

> The Less I Know The Better

{{< youtube sBzrzS1Ag_g >}}

Back when I started working as a developer (September 2021, it's been a while but not that much), work was simple: here is bug, make a branch, fix bug, commit, push, someone else will take care of the rest. I didn't know what was a pipeline, a test enviroment, how deployments work, or nothing of that stuff. And I was happy. My first year was amazing, I enjoyed every hour of it.

Later when I started to gain knowledge about how things work behind the curtain, and got into many many courses about a little bit of everything, I started to see flaws everywhere.

This made me a little bit uncomfy but I didn't pay much attention. But now there's quite a decent size elephant in the room, and can't help but feel so ummotivated when working on a codebase that is poorly thought and implemented. Usually those are the result of deadlines, lack of vision on the future, and human error (humans make mistakes, is natural and expected).

Worst part is that this feeling is just gonna grow. Even if I implemented a solution that current me would be proud of, future me with some more knowledge will check that and cringe.

## Perfection does not exist

{{< youtube 0faZ8RX8JbI >}}

I need to cope with this statement, **perfection does not exist**.

If something is working, that's good enough. We are being paid for ~~hours in front of the computer pretending to be busy~~ value delivered, not for having a nice organized code and architecture. When I realized that, I felt dissapointed. Is amazing how most things barely work, and nobody is sure how it is working. That makes me really uneasy.

But on the other-side of things, **why work harder and being recognized, when right now I'm down in the hierarchy of developers chilling and not being bothered.**

I sleep very well at night. Nobody writes me when out of office hours (I'm sadly in the whatsapp group, and oh boy that group is always active even on weekends. I never open that chat, fully silenced). Whenever the bank has an issue or something is broken, I couldn't care less cause is 100% not my fault. I get paid okish, kinda shit compared to European salaries but enough to pay rent and stay comfy at home.

Working hard and going up this organization will imply saying bye-bye to my free time and start taking responsibily for architectural and programming decisions I don't even agree to begin with.

Maybe this is a wild guess, but maybe just maybe, this is my no motivation cause.

## Conclusion

So, what is like working at a bank as a developer? Well, [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/u3b0n4/whats_it_like_working_at_a_bank_as_a_developer/) is a very good summarization. I pick these three pieces of answers as my favourites:

> Bureaucratic, tedious, frustrating and poorly paid.

> Constant blockers every step of the way. Call IT everytime you wanted to fart. Absurd change request system for every little thing. Barely learned anything after a year [...]

> If you want to chill, work at a bank and collect a stable pay cheque.
