## Context

At the time of taking this course, I already had knowledge of React.js due to a personal project that I was doing in my free time.

## Review

The course starts with the basics of React JS \(virtual DOM and components\). Then a variety of topics are covered such as:

- Creation of forms
- Control of states and properties
- Communication between components
- Routing and organization of project folders
- Use of Context API for global information management
- State management libraries \(Redux and Zustand\)
- Use of the Fetch and Axios libraries to consume REST APIs

The course is intended for people who have prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and basic programming.

## Course related skills

## Conclusion

This course is a great option for those who already have programming skills but haven't worked with React yet. The structure is very clear and well organized, which makes it easy to understand the fundamental concepts of React. In addition, the course also includes numerous practical examples and projects that help consolidate knowledge.

However, it is important to note that this course does not teach the latest React development tools and practices. Currently, the React community has moved forward and considers create-react-app deprecated, recommending the use of alternatives such as create-next-app or create-vite@latest. While the course doesn't focus on these latest tools, it's still a great introduction for those who want to learn the fundamentals of React and then move on to the latest development practices.
