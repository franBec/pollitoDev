## Context

Before taking this course, I already had previous knowledge of Scrum thanks to the training I received as a developer when I joined [Runaid](https://www.runaid.com.ar/index.php?languaje=en) and from a previous course.

## Review

The course starts by defining Agile and exploring the Agile manifesto and its supporting principles. Then delves into other Agile frameworks, including Lean, XP, Kanban, Crystal, and DSDM, and how DevOps complements Agile by accelerating the delivery and deployment of valuable software.

In this course you'll learn about:

- Scrum concepts and fundamentals: artifacts, roles, pillars, values, and lifecycle
- Sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives
- Scrum artifacts: product backlog, sprint backlog, and release backlog

The course focuses on the scrum master role, including dos and don'ts, and covers the user stories, epics, product roadmap, and estimation techniques. It explains how to communicate project progress and status, including burndown charts, burn-up charts, and other information radiators.
