## Context

In my previous job as a Web Developer in [Runaid](https://www.runaid.com.ar/index.php?languaje=en), I worked with Docker in a Next.js project.

By creating a containerized version of our application, we ensured that it would run consistently across different machines and operating systems, making it easy to deploy the application to production or other environments \(such as a local machine, a staging server, or a production server\).

## Review

This is an excellent introductory course for those who want to learn about containerization and Docker technology.

The course starts with an overview of Docker containers, followed by the installation of Docker and its components. The instructor also explains basic Docker terminology that is useful to know when working with containers. Then the course delves into launching and managing Docker containers using basic Docker commands.

The course also covers Docker image management, which is an essential aspect of Docker technology. The instructor explains how to create Docker images and containerize an application using a Dockerfile.

Overall, the course is well-structured, easy to follow, and includes practical examples that help to understand the concepts better.
