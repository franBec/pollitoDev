## Context

As a web developer with prior university education and experience, I initially had extensive knowledge of SQL.

## Review

The course is begginer-friendly. It covers the important aspects of creating and manipulating databases in SQL, with special emphasis on proper database design using best practices.

I was quite surprised to find lessons dedicated to the first, second, and third normal forms, something that is essential for someone who works with databases, and is usually a subject unknown to many.

The course also addressed the modification of existing databases, something very useful in a professional environment, one usually works with existing databases.

## Course related skills

- Design of databases in a correct and efficient way following the best practices
- Database creation using SQL in MySQL, one of the world's most popular database engines
- Manipulation of databases through the language of data manipulation in SQL
- Modification of existing databases to adapt them to new needs
- Solving practice problems and applying knowledge in practical situations

## Conclusion

The course is complete and well structured. It covers all the important aspects of creating and manipulating databases in SQL. I highly recommend it for beginners or those who want to improve their SQL skills.
