## Context

I have a solid foundation of English knowledge as I attended English classes during my childhood and adolescence. This early exposure to the language helped me build a strong understanding of grammar and vocabulary, which has served me well as I continue to use English in my day-to-day life.

I am glad to say that I am still using my English skills by consuming media and using it from time to time in my work. This ongoing practice helps me maintain and improve my proficiency in the language, allowing me to communicate effectively and confidently with others who speak English.

## Review

The EF SET Certificate exam is a convenient and effective way to test English language proficiency. The exam is entirely online, making it easy to access and take from anywhere with an internet connection.

The exam consists of multiple-choice questions, including a text comprehension section and a listening section. The text comprehension section requires reading and answering questions about a passage, while the listening section involves listening to audio recordings and answering questions based on what was heard. The questions are designed to test a range of language skills, including grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension.

You only have 50 minutes to complete the exam. This can feel like a tight timeframe, but I found it manageable. It does require a focused and efficient approach, so it's important to be prepared and focused throughout the entire exam.

## Assessed skills

- Reading comprehension: The exam tests your ability to read and understand written English, including grammar, vocabulary, and overall comprehension
- Listening comprehension: The exam tests your ability to listen and understand spoken English, including identifying key information and understanding the overall message
- Grammar and vocabulary: The exam assesses your knowledge and understanding of English grammar rules and vocabulary usage

## Conclusion
