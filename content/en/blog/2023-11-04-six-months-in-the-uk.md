Photo dump of my days in the UK. Sadly I had to leave before becoming an irregular migrant. Hopefully life takes me back there in the future

## Arriving to the UK: London, England

McDonalds breakfast meal combo. Eating a burger with coffee felt so weird first time. Then it became a favourite of mine

Payments in cash is not accepted in many places. And some places don't wanna deal with £50 notes

It is Gloucester little sister but posh town

## Glasgow, Scotland

It was a 8 hours travel by coach, all the way north out of England into Scotland
![united_kingdom_map](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/united_kingdom_map.jpg)

I just know that town exists cause of a Catfish and the Bottlemen song and an inside joke with an ex (if by any chance you are reading this, Glasgow is beautiful and I hope you can visit and even live there someday)

Commemorative plaque to those Glasgowians who died in the Falklands war. Funny enough, that war was against Argentina back in the 80s for some islands down in the Atlantic

## Back to Cheltenham, England

Sunset at Pittville Park. I have this pic as my phone screensaver

Funny sign at Pittville Park. I thought about stealing it many times but at the end I didn't let the intrusive thought win

My place in Cheltenham, 55 Pittville Lawn. The building always seemed to be in reparations but never saw any work done

Five months without a haircut and getting a little bit sad cause I knew my time in the UK was ending. Duck making an appearance in the pic

## Cilfrew, Wales

For my last two weeks in the UK I decided to go to the middle of nowhere. So I ended up in Cilfrew. Is so middle of nowhere that is difficult to show on a map. So here is Swansea, the biggest city nearby, 18km away
![swansea-location-on-the-uk-map-max](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/swansea-location-on-the-uk-map-max.jpg)

Cilfrew main road. The bus only goes though this street 3 times a day Sunday to Friday. No bus on Saturdays

Cilfrew park. Notice signs tend to be in Welsh and then in English. Welsh people are very proud of their language

I went up there the following day, there was a better view

Walking down Oak View

Tabor Chapel, just found it by chance during a walk. I didn't try to get into it, is a chappel in the middle of fucking nowhere, thanks but no thanks
![IMG_20231003_100238](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231003_100238.jpg)

Near the chappel there were the ruins of Cilfrew Colliery. It had a chill but also out of reality vibe. I was walking through middle of nowhere for a couple of hours and didn't came across another human soul during the whole walk. If it wasn't for the photos, I wonder if it was real

## Pen y Fan, highest point in Wales

Yep, I went up the highest point in Wales. It is not a difficult climb, is more of a really long long walk

The top is up passing the clouds
