Waffle time on a typical London cloudy day. I visited London a couple of times during my time there.

McDonald's breakfast meal combo. Eating a burger with coffee felt so weird the first time. Then it became a favourite of mine.

Random couches and bikes in the trash.

Mate from god knows where, but was good enough.

And a random giant fox festival.

Payments in cash are not accepted in many places. And some places don't want to deal with £50 notes.

## Cheltenham, England

It is Gloucester's little sister but a posh town.

Pittville park. This area in Cheltenham became my home.
![IMG_20230930_183924](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20230930_183924.jpg)

Geese at Pittville park. Remember them, we'll check them out in a few months.

Near the 4th of July, some buildings in the park were American-themed decorated.
![IMG_20230624_180158](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20230624_180158.jpg)

Pittville park has a nice lake.

## Birmingham, England

A couple of hours north of Cheltenham.

Bull at the Birmingham New Street Station.

Found a manga store that had many romcoms. Shout out to Worlds Apart Comic Store.

I'm more of a Fujiwara guy, but Miko is good.

Birmingham has many canals. Actually more than Venice. Source: some random posters I read while walking along the canals.

Extremely overpriced Argentinian food. For £3.90 I can buy a Tesco meal deal.
![IMG_20230729_152659](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20230729_152659.jpg)

## Bristol, England

A couple of hours south of Cheltenham.

There were random unicorns all around the city.

St Nicholas market.

I got one but from a Tesco.

## Glasgow, Scotland

It was 8-hour travel by coach, all the way north out of England into Scotland.

I just know that town exists because of a Catfish and the Bottlemen song and an inside joke with an ex. (If by any chance you are reading this, Glasgow is beautiful and I hope you can visit and even live there someday).

Commemorative plaque to those Glaswegians who died in the Falklands war. Funny enough, that war was against Argentina back in the 80s for some islands down in the Atlantic.

Equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington. [It became a tradition to always put him a traffic cone on his head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrian_statue_of_the_Duke_of_Wellington,_Glasgow#Traffic_cone).

## Back To Cheltenham, England

Sunset at Pittville Park. I have this pic as my phone screensaver.
![IMG_20230903_184604](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20230903_184604.jpg)

Funny sign at Pittville Park. I thought about stealing it many times, but in the end I didn't let the intrusive thought win.
![IMG_20230910_173109](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20230910_173109.jpg)

My place in Cheltenham, 55 Pittville Lawn. The building always seemed to be in reparations but never saw any work done.
![IMG_20230910_184535](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20230910_184535.jpg)

Remember the geese? Four months later I found them again. They grew up a lot.

Five months without a haircut. Duck making an appearance in the pic.

Saying goodbye to Pittville lawn, a quiet street where my favourite convenience store in the whole UK is.
![IMG_20230930_183903](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20230930_183903.jpg)

## Cilfrew, Wales

For my last two weeks in the UK I decided to go to the middle of nowhere. So I ended up in Cilfrew.

Cilfrew main road. The bus only goes through this street 3 times a day Sunday to Friday. No bus on Saturdays.
![IMG_20231006_094721](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231006_094721.jpg)

Cilfrew park. Notice signs tend to be in Welsh and then in English. Welsh people are very proud of their language.
![IMG_20231002_092702](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231002_092702.jpg)

Wood Country Park.
![IMG_20231002_093955](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231002_093955.jpg)

A tree with... that.
![IMG_20231002_095908](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231002_095908.jpg)

View of Cilfrew from the top of the park. Yep, clouds in every direction.
![IMG_20231002_102410](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231002_102410.jpg)

I went up there the following day, there was a better view.
![IMG_20231006_100126](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231006_100126.jpg)

Road down to the Airbnb.
![IMG_20231002_093043](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231002_093043.jpg)

My messy room.
![IMG_20231003_092455](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231003_092455.jpg)

Animals at the Airbnb.

Cutest bois.

Walking down Oak View.
![IMG_20231003_100827](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231003_100827.jpg)

Tabor Chapel, just found it by chance during a walk. I didn't try to get into it, it is a chapel in the middle of fucking nowhere, thanks but no, thanks.
![IMG_20231003_100238](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231003_100238.jpg)

Near the chapel there were the ruins of Cilfrew Colliery. It had a chill but also out-of-reality vibe. I was walking through the middle of nowhere for a couple of hours and didn't come across another human soul during the whole walk. If it wasn't for the photos, I wonder if it was real.
![IMG_20231003_103610](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231003_103610.jpg)

Bus stop on the A4109 Road.

Couldn't check Aberdulais falls.

## Pen Y Fan, The Highest Point In Wales

Yep, I went up the highest point in Wales. It is not a challenging climb, it is more of a really long walk.

The top is up passing the clouds.
![IMG_20231007_111831](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231007_111831.jpg)

I've to go through the clouds.
![IMG_20231007_112322](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231007_112322.jpg)

I'm officially above the clouds.
![IMG_20231007_114608](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231007_114608.jpg)

The view from the top.

There was a doggo ready to greet me at the top.
![IMG_20231007_123822](/uploads/2023-11-04-six-months-in-the-uk/IMG_20231007_123822.jpg)

A sandwich has never been so tasteful before.

Food truck at the end of the walk down trail.

And here's the end of all, Neath train station, waiting for the train to London.

## And Now What?

Não sei, mas vou precisar de algumas aulas de português.
