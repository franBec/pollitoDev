## Context

Before taking the course, my knowledge of MongoDB was limited to knowing that it is a NoSQL database, and a fireship 100 seconds video explanation.

## Review

The course comprehensively covers CRUD operations on MongoDB. It explains how to interact with documents and collections, how to perform advanced queries, and how to update data efficiently.

The instructor clearly and concisely explains the fundamental concepts of NoSQL databases and how MongoDB fits into this paradigm.

The practical focus of the course allows you to put into practice what you have learned immediately through exercises and real situations.

The course also covers how to work with JSON files in MongoDB. I learned how to store, retrieve, and query data in JSON format, and how to take advantage of MongoDB to work with semi-structured data.

## Course related skills

- Solid knowledge of NoSQL databases and understanding of how MongoDB fits into this paradigm
- Mastery of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in MongoDB, including the ability to interact with documents and collections, perform advanced queries, and update data efficiently
- Ability to design efficient databases in MongoDB, including data modeling and query performance optimization
- Knowledge of handling JSON files in MongoDB, including storing, retrieving, and querying data in JSON format.
- Practical skills by carrying out exercises and real projects, which allows applying theoretical knowledge in a practical environment

## Obtained certificate

- [MongoDB: Learn from zero to expert](https://udemy-certificate.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/UC-a117b533-b704-4d36-9bb0-5f2e1e30622d.pdf) - Udemy - April 2023

## Conclusion

As a developer who has always done SQL, seeing collections embedded within collections made my head think of [Third Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form) and [Edgar Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd) twisting in his grave #humor.

Although the course makes the difference of MongoDB vs. SQL very clear, it doesn't make the benefits so clear, so that was left as homework for myself.

The course is intended for anyone who wants to learn MongoDB, from beginners to those with previous database experience, as it offers a comprehensive approach.
