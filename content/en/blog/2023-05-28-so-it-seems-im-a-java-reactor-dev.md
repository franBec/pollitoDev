_Just got a job in an Ecuatorian bank._

## What was I doing during these last months...

So, about seven months ago I wrote [this](/en/blog/2022-11-13-so-it-seems-im-a-java-dev), an article where I expresed how despite not really liking Java that much, I got a position in [Yacaré](https://yacare.com/) as a Java Spring Boot dev.

> For me Java is like lemon ice cream, a flavor I would never order but it's not bad either. At least it's not mint slush.

All was nice-ish there. It was not the greatest job either, but my day to day responsabilities were almost null. That gave me plenty of time to spend most of my days doing a bunch of Udemy courses, check out the reviews of those [here](/en/categories/courses-review/).

I even got the chance to meet some co-workers in Santa Fe and Misiones (cheers to [Nico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicobrt/) and [Francisco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-gianotti-82236684/), even though they were not Applica co-workers, we were part of the same project and worked together in our day to day. They hold a special place in my memories).

Here are some random photos of the trip.

## Mental health

One day I started therapy. I can't recommend enough to anyone who has the chance, to give it a go and look after your mental health, is nice.

As an ex-musician, I think I can better put all my thoughts in song lyrics, so here are some that I related a lot during those dark February days.

> I can't really think right now in this place\
> There's too many colors enough to drive all of us insane\
> Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead\
> 'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head\
> But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet

{{< youtube ZM_Gamwxvtc >}}

> See, I'm trying to find my place\
> But it might not be here where I feel safe\
> We all learn to make mistakes\
> And run from them, from them\
> With no direction

{{< youtube oGWeHPK3NC4 >}}

> Don't kill me just help me run away\
> From everyone I need a place to stay\
> Where I can cover up my face

{{< youtube 1Mkpx1Kko0k >}}

> Viste las palabras irse\
> Desde el frío despedirse\
> Viste mis palabras se volvieron\
> Cada vez más tristes

{{< youtube P9gkGBkftgY >}}

The two big things that I got out of therapy were:

- Even though I was convinced that I had no more reason to keep living, the fact of dying was scary.
- If I'm gonna die, might as well give a last big shot, and make a fresh restart of everything.

So, I made my mind and put myself a life objective:

> If I'm dying, it won't be in Argentina.

And I did what any young and naive developer do best, start applying to job offers in linkedin.

## Devsu: an American IT Staff Augmentation company

My mail inbox was filled with rejected job applications answers, cause as a latin with no visa nor citizenship in any first world country, most HR were not really interested in giving me a chance. Fair enough.

But also got few positive answers, one of those was [Devsu](https://devsu.com/). They wanted me to go through an inverview process to maybe get the chance of a Java Spring Boot dev position in an Ecuatorian fintech project.

To be honest, I thought of ignoring this proposition. The interview process was loooooong and I wasn't feeling like wasting my free time in it. It consisted in:

- Abstract reasoning tests
- LeetCode challenges (chat gpt'ed all the way)
- A week to complete a user story (with tests and all)
- One on one technical interview

But beggars can't be choosers, so I did my best in every step and... got the job

## So what are you doing in Devsu?

I'm part of the dev team in an Ecuatorian Bank. Precisely, I'm the replacement of [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-cediel-82b9131b0/), a billiant developer (I knew him just for a week, but he seems billiant) who is leaving cause he's gonna do his masters degree in Spain.

And here is the plot twist: I'll be working with [Java Spring Webflux](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-webflux) microservices, built following [Hexagonal Architecture](https://medium.com/ssense-tech/hexagonal-architecture-there-are-always-two-sides-to-every-story-bc0780ed7d9c) philosophy, deployed in [Azure cloud services](https://azure.microsoft.com)... And I don't have any idea nor experience in any of what I just said.

> You know you're not skilled enough, experienced enough, or qualified enough to justify being there, yet you are there"

{{< youtube ZkwqZfvbdFw >}}

But anyways, I feel very welcomed to the group, and even Devsu went through the logistic problem of getting me a notebook in London (oh yeah, about that, I'm in the UK now. It's a long story totally unrelated to this new job position)

So that's a nice catchup of what is my life now... Cheers mate!
