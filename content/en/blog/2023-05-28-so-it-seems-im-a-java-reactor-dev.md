## What Was I Doing During These Last Months&hellip;?

So, about seven months ago I wrote [an article](/en/blog/2022-11-13-so-it-seems-im-a-java-dev) where I expressed how despite not really liking Java that much, I got a position in [Yacaré](https://yacare.com/) as a Java Spring Boot dev.

> For me Java is like lemon ice cream, a flavor I would never order, but it's not bad either. At least it's not mint slush.

All was nice-ish there. It was not the greatest job either, but my day-to-day responsibilities were almost null.

I even got the chance to meet some co-workers in Santa Fe and Misiones (cheers to [Nico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicobrt/) and [Francisco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-gianotti-82236684/), even though they were not Applica co-workers, we were part of the same project and worked together in our day-to-day. They hold a special place in my memories).

Here are some random photos of the trip.

## Mental Health

One day I started therapy. I can't recommend enough to anyone who has the chance to give it a go and look after your mental health, is nice.

The two big things that I got out of therapy were:

- Even though I was convinced that I had no more reason to keep living, the fact of dying was scary.
- If I'm going to die, I might as well give a last big shot and make a fresh restart of everything.

So, I made up my mind and put myself a life goal:

> If I'm dying, it won't be in Argentina.

And I did what any young and naive developer does best, start applying to job offers on LinkedIn.

## Devsu: An American IT Staff Augmentation Company

My mail inbox was filled with rejected job applications answers, because as a Latin with no visa nor citizenship in any first world country, most HR were not really interested in giving me a chance. Fair enough.

But also got a few positive answers, one of those was [Devsu](https://devsu.com/). They wanted me to go through an interview process to maybe get the chance of a Java Spring Boot dev position in an Ecuadorian fintech project.

To be honest, I thought of ignoring this proposition. The interview process was long, and I wasn't feeling like wasting my free time on it. It consisted in:

- Abstract reasoning tests.
- LeetCode challenges (ChatGPT all the way).
- A week to complete a user story (with tests and all).
- One on one technical interview.

But beggars can't be choosers, so I did my best in every step and... got the job

## So What Are You Doing in Devsu?

I'm part of the dev team in an Ecuatorian Bank. Precisely, I'm the replacement of [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-cediel-82b9131b0/), a billiant developer (I knew him just for a week, but he seems brilliant) who is leaving because he's going to do his master's degree in Spain.

And here is the plot twist: I'll be working with [Java Spring Webflux](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-webflux) microservices, built following [Hexagonal Architecture](https://medium.com/ssense-tech/hexagonal-architecture-there-are-always-two-sides-to-every-story-bc0780ed7d9c) philosophy, deployed in [Azure cloud services](https://azure.microsoft.com)... And I don't have any idea nor experience in any of what I just said.

> You know you're not skilled enough, experienced enough, or qualified enough to justify being there, yet you are there

{{< youtube ZkwqZfvbdFw >}}

But anyway, I feel very welcomed to the group, and even Devsu went through the logistic problem of getting me a notebook in London (oh yeah, about that, I'm in the UK now. It's a long story totally unrelated to this new job position)

So that's a nice catchup of what is my life now... Cheers mate!
