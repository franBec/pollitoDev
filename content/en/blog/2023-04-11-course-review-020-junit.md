## Context

Before taking this course, I already had experience in unit testing due to previous courses I had attended. However, these courses were based on older versions of JUnit, which means my knowledge was out of date.

## Review

This course is an excellent choice for those looking to learn how to write unit tests in Java effectively using JUnit 5 and Mockito, along with TDD and BDD best practices.

The course includes a comprehensive focus on integrating unit tests with Spring Boot: unit testing annotations are covered, as well as using tools like MockMvc and WebTestClient.

An addendum on consuming and testing RESTful web services with Swagger is also included, giving a full focus on integration testing in this context.

## Course related skills

- Apply the best practices in unit tests with Spring Boot Starter Test: JUnit 5, Mockito, SpringBootTest, DataJpaTest, WebMvcTest, MockMvc, WebTestClient, Hamcrest, JsonPath, among others
- Write unit tests with IntelliJ IDEA both in its free version and in its Community version, it brings tools to write and execute unit tests efficiently
- Apply Test Driven Development (TDD) and Test Driven Behavior (BDD) practices

- Write integration tests with DataJpaTest and WebTestClient which allows testing the behavior of the application at runtime and verifying the integration between its components
