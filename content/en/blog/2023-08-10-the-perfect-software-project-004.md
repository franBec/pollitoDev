## The short search for a layout

Today we are gonna keep it simple, the objective is to get a working layout. After googling for a little while, I'm gonna use [this](https://play.tailwindcss.com/uOnWQzR9tl) as a base.

## Some little adjustments

- Layout
  - Remove the left sidebar. Even though real SIGEM have one in specific scenarios, I think it is very intrusive.
  - Put the corresponding tailwind color classes where needed.
- Header
  - Put a "San Luis La Ciudad" logo top left, and a login + toogle dark/light mode top right
- Main
  - Display "SIGEM" logo and a sample text.
- Footer
  - Always good to leave your personal touch there üê§.

And this is the final result...

The few occasions I had to do frontend, I find it handy to develop distributing the screen 2/3 code 1/3 app. Without realising, you end up developing some mobile-friendly interfaces.
