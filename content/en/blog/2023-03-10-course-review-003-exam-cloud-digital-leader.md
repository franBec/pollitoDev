## Context

After earning the Google Cloud Digital Leader Training badges, I decided to supplement my knowledge with additional resources, such as blogs and YouTube videos, to better prepare for the Google Cloud Digital Leader Exam.

## Review

The exam is proctored online that can be taken from the comfort of your home or office. Before scheduling your exam, it's important to review system requirements, including internet speed and webcam and microphone functionality. You must schedule the exam at Webassessor, download a secure browser provided by them, and create a biometric profile.

On the day of the exam, you must ensure that you meet all the requirements of the testing environment, including a quiet, well-lit room and no other people or items in the testing area. The exam is multiple choice and you should be prepared to sit through the entire exam without taking a break or moving out of camera view. Finally, a government-issued photo ID is required, which must match the legal first and last name on Webassessor.
