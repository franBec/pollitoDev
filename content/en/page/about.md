## Are you a frontend dev? a backend dev? fullstack dev? What do you do?

> The stereotype that fullstack are jack of all trade master of none is a little disingenuous and incredible unfair

{{< youtube rAjd8z-Fx5A >}}

These classifications are very different depending of who you are talking to, and it gets even worse when you talk to a people outside the programmer world

So... I am a **web developer**: someone who creates web pages for users

But not all web developers are the same, so here it is what I am good at
